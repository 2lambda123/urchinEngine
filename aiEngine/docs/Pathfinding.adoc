* Legend:
** [red black-background]*Red*: `PathNode` is link between two `NavTriangle` which belong to the path.
** [green black-background]*Green*: `PathPortal` is a line segment between two `PathNode`.
** [blue black-background]*Blue*: `PathPortal#getTransitionPoint()` represents a transition (turning point, jump start/end, different topography) in the path. Turning points are determined by the funnel algorithm.
** [fuchsia black-background]*Fuchsia*: `PathPoint` represents a point of the final path. They are basically the transition points + others points to follow the topography.
