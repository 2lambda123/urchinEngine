# To do :
############################################
- GLOBAL
	- (1) [NEW FEATURE] Create new shape type: heighfield mesh
	- (3) [OPTIMIZATION] Use PGO in g++
- BROADPHASE
	- (2) [OPTIMIZATION] Use a memory pool when create new OverlappingPair
	- (2) [OPTIMIZATION] Avoid to recompute objects AABBox at each frame: store pre-computed AABBox valid for any rotation
	- (2) [OPTIMIZATION] Implement double AABBox trees: static and dynamic (see Bullet)
	- (2) [OPTIMIZATION] Rebalance AABBox tree for better performance
- NARROWPHASE
	- (2) [NEW FEATURE] Support joints between shapes
	- (2) [OPTIMIZATION] Use a memory pool when transfom a shape to object (i.e.: CollisionBoxShape#toConvexObject)
	- (3) [OPTIMIZATION] GJK, don't test voronoi region opposite to last point added (2D: A, B, AB | 3D: ABC).
	- (3) [OPTIMIZATION] EPA, add new point on convex hull to improve thanks to adjacent edges: find more faster triangles visible by new point (see Reactphysics3d code)
	- (2) [OPTIMIZATION] Use a memory pool when create a result of GJK and EPA algorithm
- PROCESSABLE
	- (2) [NEW FEATURE] Handle stair for character controller
	- (3) [NEW FEATURE] Apply impusle on objects hit by character

# Bugs :
############################################
- CONSTRAINT SOLVER
	- (2) A restitution of 1.0 introduce new force in the system. Example: a superball bounces more and more higher at each collision
- ISLAND
	- (2) A body balancing from one side to the other side (ex: cone on his base) could sleep when velocity reach zero
